            <h1>What is Neuroblastoma?</h1>
            <p>Neuroblastoma is a type of pediatric cancer that develops
                in the nervous system of babies and young children.
                Neuroblastoma grows in immature nerve tissue (neuroblasts).
                It usually affects neuroblasts in the adrenal glands (small
                organs that sit on top of the kidneys). The adrenal glands
                make hormones that control automatic body functions, such
                as digestion, blood pressure, breathing and heart rate.
                Neuroblastoma can also develop in nerve tissue in the spinal cord,
                abdomen, chest or neck. It can spread to other parts of the body.

            <p>The Ben Kerr foundation has a total commitment to supporting chidren with 
                Neuroblastoma. Funds gotten through donations are used to support children 
                by covering the cost of hospital bills incured from chemotherapy, surgery, 
                radiation therapy, immunotherapy and other forms of treatment.</p>
